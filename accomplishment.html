        <h3>Graduated High School with Honors</h3>
        <p>
          One of my biggest accomplishments in my life was getting through high school with good grades, in the begging of freshman and sophomore year my grades really started to tank with COVID coming around and pushing through and still succeeding was a major accomplishment with all the difficulties and challenges i had to face along the way. I graduated and got to walk and show my family that despite everything we were going through i still had the drive and motivation to succeed and make things happen, hell i even touched down at mjc for a year after highschool and really tried to deep dive and discover what id wanna do with my life but things are always easier said than done and im sure we all know that.

        <h3>Musically gifted</h3>
        <p>
          Another Accomplishment that was a fun one for me was learning piano, all throughout my childhood i loved music, i picked up saxophone in elementary school and going into middle school i also picked up piano. Piano opened a doorway into music that no other instrument could, the accessibility and freedom you get with a digital keyboard let me practice and have fun making new things in ways my traditional piano couldn't and just being able to pickup those instruments at all was a huge goal and i crushed it, i know i know not a super major accomplishment but it still means so much to me to be able to connect with other through music and playing together and its been a major goal in my life to be musically tallented.
